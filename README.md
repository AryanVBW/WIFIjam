</p>

## Features
- Cross-platform: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Detects OS and WiFi adapter capabilities
- Lists WiFi adapters and scans for networks (all OSes)
- On Linux, can attempt deauth (with monitor mode and compatible adapter)
- On macOS/Windows, shows detailed WiFi info and warns about limitations
- Robust error handling, clear user guidance, and optional scan result saving

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- [Scapy](https://scapy.net/) (auto-installs if missing)
- Linux: `iw`, `iwconfig`, `iwlist` or `iw dev`, `ip`, `sudo`
- macOS: `airport` utility (included on most systems)
- Windows: No extra requirements (uses built-in `netsh`)

## Usage

### Linux
1. (Optional) Put your WiFi adapter in monitor mode (the script can attempt this for you):
   ```bash
   sudo iw <iface> set monitor control
   sudo ip link set <iface> up
   ```
2. Run the script as root:
   ```bash
   sudo python3 wifi_deauth_universal.py
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to select your interface, scan for networks, and (if supported) perform a deauth attack.

### macOS
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python3 wifi_deauth_universal.py
   ```
2. You can scan for nearby WiFi networks and view info. Deauth/jamming is not supported on most hardware.

### Windows
1. Run the script:
   ```cmd
   python wifi_deauth_universal.py
   ```
2. You can scan for nearby WiFi networks and view info. Deauth/jamming is not supported on most hardware.

## Capabilities & Limitations
- **Linux:**
  - Can perform deauth/jamming if you have a compatible adapter in monitor mode.
  - Can scan for networks and show info.
- **macOS:**
  - Can scan for networks and show info.
  - Deauth/jamming is not supported except with rare USB adapters and custom drivers.
- **Windows:**
  - Can scan for networks and show info.
  - Deauth/jamming is not supported except with rare hardware (e.g., AirPcap).

## Safety & Disclaimer
- **This tool is for educational and authorized security testing only.**
- Unauthorized use of WiFi jamming or deauthentication is illegal in many countries.
- The authors provide no warranty and are not responsible for misuse or damages.

## Thank You üôè

This project was inspired by the incredible YouTube tutorial "WIFI Jamming in Python" and [Python Network Hacking with Kali Linux and Scapy](https://youtu.be/O1jpck31Ask?si=4h8BinIB1dnRQrQs),  which provided valuable insights into building an Exif data tool.

A heartfelt thanks to David Bombal for his fantastic [red python script on GitHub](https://github.com/davidbombal/red-python-scripts), which served as a guiding resource during development.

To the open-source community, developers, and testers: your support makes this project thrive.
